My first Django project, following the official django tutorial. I'm using Eclipse
with PyDev and EGit:
- [Writing your first Django app, part 1](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro/tutorial01/ "Writing your first Django app, part 1")
- [Writing your first Django app, part 2](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro/tutorial02/ "Writing your first Django app, part 2")
- [Writing your first Django app, part 3](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro/tutorial03/ "Writing your first Django app, part 3")


Concepts:
- url pattern:
A parametrized url defined in an bnhhbggggurlconf.
e.g.: /newsarchive/\<year>/\<month>/
- urlconf:
urlpatterns list contained in the app url module.
